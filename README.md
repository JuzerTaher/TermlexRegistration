# TermlexRegistration
Here, I have created an user registration form using HTML-5 validation and Angular framework.

The HTML validation deals with client side validation where the data entered in the form is validated at the time of entry itself.
I have used the Angular framework to display the complete address in a single message by using the alert dailogue box.

I have added three screenshots in the repository to display the working of the webpage.
